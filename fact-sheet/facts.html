  <div class= "descr">Depression, or as it is formally diagnosed, Major Depression Disorder, can range from a debilitating condition to one that can be well-managed as a high-functioning adult. If you have ever felt sad, off, or had thoughts of self harm for more than a couple weeks it is worth talking to a doctor to see if you may have depression. There are a variety of treatment options which most commonly include therapy and medication, so don't lose hope if you don't feel well now.</div>

  <div class="pic-box"> <h3> Anxiety </h3> <img src="/~gibsonfa/INLS572-mentalhealth/images/anxiety.jpeg" alt=""></div>
  <div class= "descr">
Anxiety comes in many different forms and effects around 20% of the population in a given year. Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety, and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) are some common types. Like depression, these disorders can be managed, but people with anxiety still can experience severe symptoms of restlessness, racing thoughts, difficulty concentrating, increased heart rate, and others. You can also take therapy and medications to help with anxiety.  </div>
